This example shows how to deploy a Java application with EAP XP 5 on OpenShift.

## Prerequisites

## Source Code

The source code for the backend is hosted at https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap-xp5-getting-started.git

It is a simple application that uses JAX-RS to exposes HTTP endpoint.

## Installation

The application is built with Bootable Jar.

### Installation with Bootable Jar

The application can be compiled as a Bootable Jar.
In that case, the Helm Chart is configured with `build.mode=bootable-jar`.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ helm install eap-xp5-app -f examples/eap-xp5/getting-started/app.yaml ./charts/eap-xp5
----

## Deployment

Once the chart is installed, let's wait for the application to be built and deployed:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get deployment/eap-xp5-app -w
NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
eap-xp5-app               0/1     1            0           27s
...
eap-xp5-app               1/1     1            1           5m29s
----

## Use the application

Once the application is deployed on OpenShift, it can be accessed from the route `eap-xp5-app`.
Let's find the host that we can use to connect to this backend:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get route eap-xp5-app -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}"
eap-xp5-app-jmesnil1-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

This value will be different for every installation of the application.

We can then query this application by calling one of its HTTP endpoints from the URL above.

## Clean up

The application can be deleted by running the command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ helm delete eap-xp5-app 
release "eap-xp5-app " uninstalled
----
